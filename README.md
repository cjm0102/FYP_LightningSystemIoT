Smart Home Automation System focus in Ligtning System

Designed and developed a smart lighting system to automate home lighting.
Utilized C++ for programming the control logic and integrated sensors for detecting presence and adjusting lighting accordingly.
Focused on energy efficiency and user convenience, showcasing a practical application of IoT and smart technology.

General Functionalities:
Totally got 3 + 2 ways to control and manage this whole system
Remote Control:  Allows users to control the lighting system from a short distance using a remote device. This provides convenience and flexibility, enabling users to adjust lightning without having to physically interact with the light switches. 
Switch: Traditional wall switches are incorporated for manual control, ensuring that users  can still operate the lights in a familiar manner. This functionality serves as a backup and an option for those who prefer conventional methods.
Phone Application Control: A mobile application is to provide users with the ability to manage the lighting system through their smartphones. This app allows for on-the-go adjustments, scheduling, and monitoring of the lighting conditions in real-time.
Voice Command: Integration with voice assistants (Google Assistant) enables users to control the lighting system through voice commands. This hands-free operation enhances user convenience and accessibility, especially in situations where manual operation is impractical.
Schedule:  Users can set up schedules to automate the lighting system according to their daily routines. This feature helps in energy conservation by ensuring lights are only on when needed and adds to the overall convenience by reducing the need for manual adjustments.
